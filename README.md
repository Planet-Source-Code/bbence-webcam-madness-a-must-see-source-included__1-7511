### Description

NOW With SOURCE! (Last time I haven't included it) .I have recently submitted a code, which downloaded a picture from a webcam. With this code, you can add your own links to webcams and other often-changing pictures to the programs database and view it simply selecting from the menu. This program also implements a favourites list what has it's own menu. Just look at the picture and download it. Oh, and please don't forget to vote for it and send feedback. Thanks.
